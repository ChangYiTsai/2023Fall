# PDS Challenge 3: Matrix Completion for Recommendation Systems
# Abstract
 In this challenge, we delve into the critical role of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in ma
trix completion and imputation. SVD plays a pivotal role in predicting user preferences and filling
 in missing data in platforms like YouTube and Netflix, where recommendation systems heavily rely
 on its intricate workings. By applying SVD, we enable the accurate reconstruction of incomplete
 matrices, thereby enhancing user experiences and personalizing content recommendations.
