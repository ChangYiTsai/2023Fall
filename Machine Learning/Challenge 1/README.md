# PDS Challenge 1:
 Weighted and Regularized kNN for Classification
 September 29, 2023
 ## Abstract
 In this first challenge, we embark on the development and analysis of a specialized k-nearest
 neighbors (kNN) algorithm designed for classification. Our exploration delves into two nuanced
 variations of the kNN algorithm: (i) a version using a weighted distance for the feature coordinates,
 where the weights are chosen to maximize classification accuracy, and (i) a version that considers
 the marginal distribution of the labels and preserves this distribution during inference.
